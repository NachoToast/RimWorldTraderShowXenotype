### Installation Guide

This mod is a standard C# RimWorld mod, meaning once you clone the repository into your local mods folder, all you need to do is open the [solution file](../Source/TSX1.4/Trader%20Show%20Xenotype.sln) using Visual Studio, add all the required references, and then build the project.

For more information, see the [RimWorld modding tutorials](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials/Setting_up_a_solution#Option_1_.28Manual_Method.29:).
